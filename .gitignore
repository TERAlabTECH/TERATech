# Vuforia-specific ignores
# Depending on your Vuforia version and usage, you might have specific files to ignore.
# Generally, you'd want to ignore large datasets and temporary files, but ensure any needed
# assets or configuration files are included in your repository.

# Other tools or specific files you use might require additional entries.

# Add other ignores as necessary based on your project's needs.
